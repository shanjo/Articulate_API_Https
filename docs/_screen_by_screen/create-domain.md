# Create Domain Screen

This screen allows you to create a domain. For more information on domains see Concepts/Basic Chatbots and Concepts/Domains.

![Starting screen for conveyor]({{ "/img/screens/createDomain.png" | absolute_url }})

1. **Domain Name** - Give your Domain a name.
2. **Intent Recognition Threshold** - For an in depth review of how this is used see Concepts/Dialogue, but for the most part this slider indicated how much confidence your agent must have before it actually responds with an intent.
