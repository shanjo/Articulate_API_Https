1. **Entity Table** - Each row represents an entity that you've created. You can quickly see what color the entity is in highlighted examples.
2. **Used In** - Clicking the toggle by each entity expands a list: showing you which intents are using that entity.
3. **Entity Menu** - Use these three dots to open a menu, which will allow you to edit or delete the entity.
