# Create Entity Screen

This screen allows you to create entities for you Agent. For a better understanding of what entities are check out Concepts/Basic Chatbots.

![Starting screen for conveyor]({{ "/img/screens/createEntity.png" | absolute_url }})

1. **Entity Name** - Give your entity a name.
2. **Example Values** - Type in an entity value and hit enter.
3. **Synonyms** - It's often helpful for similar terms to be resolved to the same value. For example NYC, New York City, the Big Apple all refer to the same location. If you define all of those values as a synonym for NYC then any user request which uses them would get identified as NYC. This helps a lot for Concepts/Fulfillment.
4. **Entity Color** - In the Create Intent screen you'll highlight entities in example sentences. The highlight color is chosen from this list. You can customize the color fo each entity so that they better stand out when you are editing intents.
